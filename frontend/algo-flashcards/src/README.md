# Frontend Developer Notes

- All React components are in `src/components/`.
- Styles are in `src/styles/`.
- Assets (images/icons) are in `src/assets/`.
- Use `npm run dev` to start the dev server.

## Component Organization

- Move all presentational and container components into `src/components/`.
- Example structure:
  - `components/Deck/DeckDropdown.jsx`
  - `components/Card/CardDetail.jsx`

- Keep `App.jsx`, `main.jsx`, and `api.js` at the root of `src/`.
